## Terraform ECS
### What does this code do?
The code present in this repository is used to define and deploy a dockerised container in AWS ECS.
This is done by calling a [module](https://github.com/companieshouse/terraform-modules/tree/main/aws/ecs) from terraform-modules. Application specific attributes are injected and the service is then deployed using Terraform via the CICD platform 'Concourse'.
Application specific attributes | Value                                | Description
